The data of around 5000+ movies were extracted and a csv file was created. This csv file(movies.csv)had to be in the same directory as R.There are 5044 rows and 28 columns.There were 2059 missing values in the dataset and missing values in each column was obtained. Later, the proportion of missing values was calculated. And the mean was found to be very less. Hence, the missing values were omitted. 
  An exploratory analysis was conducted by plotting graphs between two different variables. By the graphs we could understand how those variables are related to each other. Correlation was calculated by the graphs, where some variables showed high positive correlation,like imdb_scores vs number_of_voted users. 
To run these on R, import the required packages and load those packages. The packages required are ggplot2,CRAN,plyer. After loading these packages, run the file. (vis. R) file has  the code used for exploratory analysis.
 Prediction analysis was carried followed by exploratory analysis. By exploratory analysis we understood that facenumber_in_poster and aspect_ratio are the two variables which don't help much in the prediction process. 
The dataset was split into testset, validation set and training set. The RMSE and MSE was calculated for the three sets. The error was reduced testset 2 when compared to test set 1. Later a linear regression model was developed and R-squared was found to be 0.258~0.26. Looking at the regression outputs and diagnostics, we can conclude that a linear model is the best model for this relationship. The packages reuired are ggplot2,plyr,stats.
